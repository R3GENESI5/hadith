# Al-Itqan (الإتقان) — Quran–Hadith Knowledge Bridge

> *"Itqan"* (إتقان) means mastery, perfection, and precision in craft. This project applies that principle to Islamic source texts: every connection between the Quran and the Hadith corpus is grounded in classical Arabic root morphology, not keyword guessing.

A fully static, offline-capable Islamic study platform connecting **87,688 Sunni hadiths** across **18 books** to the **Quran** through **1,651 Arabic roots** and **39 thematic families** — with no backend, no database, and no API required.

---

## What This Is

Most Quran/Hadith apps do English keyword search on translations. Al-Itqan operates at the level classical scholars worked: **Arabic root morphology**. The root `صوم` connects every Quran verse about fasting to every hadith whose Arabic text contains a word derived from that root — whether the word is `صيام`, `يصوم`, `الصائم`, `صُمْتُ`, or `صوموا`. One root, all its forms, across both corpora at once.

The result is a set of open JSON files that any developer can load and build on, plus a live web app that uses them.

### Root Canonicalization: The Hidden Problem

CAMeL Tools and the Quran roots index use different canonical forms for the same root. This is a known NLP challenge with Arabic:

| Root concept | Quran form | CAMeL form | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| judgment/judiciary | قضي | قضو | Defective verb (ي→و) |
| pledge/sale | بيع | بوع | Hollow verb (middle ي→و) |
| faith/belief | أمن | ومن | Hamza normalization |
| guide | هدي | هدو | Defective verb |

**Fix:** `src/root_alias_map.json` — 131 entries mapping Quran root forms to CAMeL canonical forms. `build_bridge.py` applies this map before looking up words, recovering **4,977 additional word→root mappings**.

---

## The JSON Files

### `word_defs_v2.json` (6.7 MB)

The morphological dictionary. Every significant Arabic word in the corpus mapped to its root and definition.

```json
"صلي": {
  "r":   "صلو",
  "g":   "to pray, perform the ritual prayer",
  "d":   "Lane's Lexicon full definition (truncated to 500 chars)...",
  "n":   2847,
  "lem": "صلى",
  "pos": "verb",
  "form": "I"
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `r` | Arabic root (CAMeL canonical form) |
| `g` | Short gloss |
| `d` | Lane's Lexicon definition |
| `n` | Corpus frequency (how many hadiths contain this word) |
| `lem` | Lemma (base form) |
| `pos` | Part of speech |
| `form` | Verb form I–X (if verb) |
| `_patched` | `true` if added by patch script, not CAMeL |

**Power:** Any Arabic word in any hadith is one lookup away from its root, grammar, and classical definition. Foundation of the word panel, root navigation, and cross-reference features.

---

### `concordance.json` (22 MB)

The **Mu'jam al-Mufahris** — the classical concordance index. Medieval scholars like Fuad Abd al-Baqi spent decades compiling this by hand. Here it is computed.

```json
"صلاه":  ["bukhari:2",   "muslim:5",   "abudawud:12",  ...],
"يوم":   ["bukhari:1",   "musannaf_ibnabi_shaybah:47", ...],
"تقوي":  ["tirmidhi:4",  "bukhari:6551", ...]
```

- **32,410 words** indexed
- **1,149,723 total entries** (word × hadith pairs)
- Cap of **2,000 hadith IDs per word** (prevents ultra-common words from dominating)
- IDs format: `book_id:hadith_number_in_book`

**Power:** Click any Arabic word in the reader → instantly retrieve every hadith in the corpus that contains it, across all 18 books. Full-text search with zero search engine infrastructure.

---

### `quran_hadith_bridge.json` (21 MB)

The core innovation. Every Quran root connected to its hadiths, with classical definitions from two sources.

```json
"صوم": {
  "ayahs":         ["2:183", "2:184", "2:185", "2:187", ...],
  "ayah_count":    14,
  "hadith_ids":    ["bukhari:1771", "muslim:2502", "nasai:2106", ...],
  "hadith_count":  892,
  "book_breakdown": {
    "musannaf_ibnabi_shaybah": 312,
    "bukhari": 124,
    "muslim":  98,
    "nasai":   87
  },
  "words_in_hadith": ["صوم", "صيام", "يصوم", "الصائم", "صوموا", ...],
  "families":      ["worship", "purity"],
  "definitions": {
    "quran_meaning": "fasting, abstaining from food and desire",
    "mufradat":      "Raghib al-Isfahani: صوم means to restrain oneself...",
    "lanes":         "Lane's Lexicon: the act of abstaining from food..."
  },
  "frequency_quran": 14
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ayahs` | All Quran verse references containing this root |
| `hadith_ids` | All hadith IDs whose Arabic text contains a word from this root |
| `book_breakdown` | Per-book count of matched hadiths |
| `words_in_hadith` | The actual Arabic word forms found in the corpus |
| `families` | Which thematic families this root belongs to |
| `definitions.mufradat` | Classical definition from Raghib al-Isfahani (d. 1108 CE) |
| `definitions.lanes` | Definition from Edward William Lane's Arabic–English Lexicon |

**Power:** Open any Quran ayah → surface every related hadith. Open any hadith → see which Quranic roots its vocabulary maps to. The cross-reference layer that no existing open-source Quran/Hadith app has at this depth.

---

### `family_corpus.json` (12.6 MB)

39 thematic families, each a pre-curated corpus spanning both Quran and Hadith.

```json
"end_of_times": {
  "name_ar":     "أشراط الساعة والأخروية",
  "meaning":     "Signs of the Hour, eschatology, resurrection, grave, trials before the Day of Judgment",
  "roots":       ["فتن", "قوم", "بعث", "حشر", "نفخ", "قبر", "موت", "روح", ...],
  "root_count":  24,
  "ayah_count":  1388,
  "hadith_count": 14572,
  "hadith_ids":  [...],
  "book_breakdown": {
    "musannaf_ibnabi_shaybah": 4821,
    "bukhari": 621,
    "muslim":  534
  },
  "root_stats": [
    {"root": "فتن", "ayah_count": 58,  "hadith_count": 360},
    {"root": "قوم", "ayah_count": 70,  "hadith_count": 2140},
    {"root": "بعث", "ayah_count": 67,  "hadith_count": 890}
  ]
}
```

**The 39 families:**

| Family | Ayahs | Hadiths | Notes |

| ... | | | |
| deception_hypocrisy | 354 | 3,479 | Nifaq, lying, betrayal |

★ = new families added in this project

**Power:** A researcher studying eschatology calls `family_corpus["end_of_times"].hadith_ids` and gets 14,572 pre-identified hadiths across 18 books, cross-referenced to 1,388 Quran ayahs, broken down by root — without writing a single database query.

---

### `narrator_index.json` (0.6 MB)

Every narrator name found in the corpus, with hadith counts and book distribution.

```json
"أبو هريرة": {
  "total": 5374,
  "books": {
    "bukhari": 446,
    "muslim":  618,
    "abudawud": 977
  },
  "grade": "thiqah"
}
```

**Power:** Foundation for the isnad visualizer. Any narrator → their full transmission record across all 18 books.

---

### `hadith_connections.json` (4.2 MB)

Cross-book connections: hadiths that share matn (text), topic, or ruling pattern.

```json
"bukhari:1": {
  "connected": [
    {"id": "muslim:1907", "type": "shared_matn",  "score": 0.94},
    {"id": "nasai:75",    "type": "shared_ruling", "score": 0.71}
  ]
}
```

**Power:** "See also" links across books. When a user reads Bukhari:1, they can navigate to the same hadith in Muslim, Nasa'i, and other books instantly.

## The Chord Graphs

`app/chord.html` — a self-contained interactive visualization (no server needed, data embedded inline).

![Family × Family chord diagram](docs/screenshots/chord-families.png)
*39 thematic families as arcs — chord width = number of hadiths shared between two families*

![Book × Family distribution](docs/screenshots/chord-books.png)
*Blues = 18 books, Oranges = top 15 families — chord width = hadith contribution*

### Tab 1: Family × Family Overlap

A D3.js chord diagram with 39 arcs (one per family). The width of each chord between two arcs equals the number of hadiths that belong to **both** families simultaneously.

**What it reveals:**

- **worship ↔ movement_journey** — thick chord: prayer hadiths reference prostration, standing, and travel to the mosque; pilgrimage hadiths reference prayer at every station
- **statecraft ↔ justice** — thick chord: Islamic governance and judicial fairness are treated as inseparable in hadith literature; the qadi (judge) and the caliph appear in the same hadiths
- **end_of_times ↔ life_death** — expected overlap: resurrection, the grave, and the soul sit in both families
- **family_law ↔ provision** — thick chord: marriage contracts, mahr, and nafaqa (maintenance) are economic as much as personal
- **jihad ↔ fighting** — overlapping but distinct: jihad roots (جهد, شهد, غزو) are more specific than the broader fighting family (حرب, قتل, سلح)

**Interaction:** hover any arc → see its total hadith count and top 4 overlapping families. Click to isolate all its chords. Click background to reset.

### Tab 2: Book × Family Distribution

Blues = 18 books. Oranges = top 15 families. Each chord = "this book contributes X hadiths to this family."

**What it reveals:**

- **Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah** is the dominant blue arc: 37,943 hadiths (43% of the corpus) means it feeds every family substantially, often more than all other books combined
- **Bukhari and Muslim** are smaller arcs but their chords to `worship` and `knowledge` are proportionally large — these sahih collections are denser in legal/theological hadiths per page
- **Shamail al-Muhammadiyah** connects heavily to `body` and `speech_communication` — it is a book specifically about the Prophet's physical appearance and character
- **Nawawi 40, Qudsi 40** are tiny arcs but connect disproportionately to `knowledge`, `guidance`, `heart_soul` — they are curated theological summaries, each hadith carefully chosen
- **Shah Waliullah 40** barely registers — its hadiths are very short matn-only texts with minimal vocabulary for the concordance to index

---

## The Concordance Audit Dashboard

`app/concordance_audit.html` — a Chart.js verification dashboard used during development.

![Concordance & Bridge Audit Dashboard](docs/screenshots/concordance-audit.png)
*Five-chart data quality dashboard: family coverage, top roots, per-book indexing, word frequency, and Quran↔Hadith correlation*

Five charts:
1. **39 families bar chart** — hadith coverage per family, new families highlighted in red
2. **Top 40 roots** — hadith count vs ayah count side by side; shows which roots are over/under-represented between the two corpora
3. **Per-book coverage** — total hadiths vs concordance entries per book; verifies every book is indexed
4. **Word frequency distribution** — histogram of how many words appear in 1–4 hadiths vs 5–19 vs ... vs 2000 (cap). Most words are rare; ~81 words hit the 2000 cap including صلي, قال, كان
5. **Quran freq vs Hadith count scatter** — hover any dot to see root + meaning. Shows rough positive correlation but interesting outliers: roots frequent in Quran but rare in Hadith (abstract theological), and roots rare in Quran but very frequent in Hadith (legal practice detail)

## The AI Layer — Three Integrated Engines

This repo contains the **data layer** that powers Al-Itqan. Three open-source tools form the **AI layer**, running on HuggingFace Spaces as optional APIs on top of the fully-static core.

| Engine | Space | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| KASHAF — Isnad Visualizer | (local, `app/isnad.html`) | ✅ Integrated |
| BasilSuhail — Semantic Search | [iqrossed/al-itqan-search](https://huggingface.co/spaces/iqrossed/al-itqan-search) | ✅ Deployed |
| HadithRAG — Conversational Q&A | [iqrossed/al-itqan-rag](https://huggingface.co/spaces/iqrossed/al-itqan-rag) | ✅ Deployed |

The FAISS semantic index (87,056 hadiths, `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`, 216MB) is hosted at [`iqrossed/al-itqan-index`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/iqrossed/al-itqan-index) and shared by both Spaces.

### KASHAF — Isnad Visualizer
**Source:** `github.com/OmarShafie/hadith`
**What it is:** A Sankey/flow diagram that shows how a hadith was transmitted: narrator A → narrator B → narrator C → the Prophet (ﷺ). Built with Papa Parse + PEG.js for parsing chains, Google Charts for the Sankey.
**Current state:** Works only for Bukhari, loads a static CSV, uses Google Charts (requires internet).
**What Al-Itqan takes:**
- The Sankey data model: `[source_narrator, target_narrator, hadith_count]` rows
- The narrator reliability color-coding logic (thiqah = green, da'if = red, unknown = grey)

**What Al-Itqan changes:**
- Google Charts → **D3-sankey** (MIT, self-hosted, offline-capable)
- Bukhari-only CSV → `narrator_index.json` across **all 18 books**
- Static CSV → dynamic: user selects book, transmission depth, minimum chain length
- Every narrator arc links to their full hadith list in the reader

**Status:** Planned for Phase 2. Not yet built into this repo.

---

### BasilSuhail — Semantic Search
**Source:** `github.com/BasilSuhail/Quran-Hadith-Application-Database`
**What it is:** A Flask app using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) + `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence embeddings to do semantic search over a ~15k hadith subset. Type "forgiveness of sins" → get the most semantically similar hadiths even if the exact words don't match.
**Current state:** Works but uses an English-first embedding model on Arabic text, covers only ~15k hadiths, runs as a local Flask server.
**What Al-Itqan takes:**
- The two-corpus unified search concept (Quran + Hadith in one query)
- The FAISS nearest-neighbor retrieval pattern
- The result schema: `{type, text, reference, score}`

**What Al-Itqan upgrades:**
- 15k hadiths → **87,688 hadiths** (all books)
- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (English-first) → **`CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-ca`** (Classical Arabic domain, Apache-2.0) with mean-pool to produce sentence vectors
- Flask local server → **HuggingFace Spaces** (Gradio, free GPU hosting)
- No context → **every result tagged with root family** from `quran_hadith_bridge.json`, so "find hadiths about mercy" surfaces results with the `رحم` root highlighted

**Pre-computation pipeline** (to be built as `src/build_semantic_index.py`):
1. Embed each hadith's Arabic matn with camelbert-ca
2. Build FAISS IndexFlatIP (cosine similarity on L2-normalised vectors)
3. Save: `semantic_index.faiss` + `semantic_meta.json`
4. Deploy on HuggingFace Space

**API contract:**
```
GET /search?q=مكارم+الأخلاق&limit=10&filter_family=knowledge&filter_grade=sahih
→ [{type, text, reference, score, family, grade}, ...]
```

**Status:** Planned for Phase 3. Not yet built. The root bridge data is ready to enrich it when it is.

---

### HadithRAG — Conversational Q&A
**Source:** `github.com/Quchluk/HadithRAG`
**What it is:** A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using ChromaDB + a language model. Ask a question → retrieve relevant hadiths from vector store → generate a cited answer. The key innovation in HadithRAG is storing the full isnad (chain of narration) in the vector metadata, so the LLM can include the chain in its answer.
**Current state:** Prototype with a small corpus, ChromaDB, and GPT-4 as the generator.
**What Al-Itqan takes:**
- The isnad-preserving schema: full chain text stored in vector metadata, not stripped out
- The retrieval loop: query → top-K hadiths → LLM generates answer with citations

**What Al-Itqan upgrades:**
- Small prototype corpus → **87,688 hadiths**
- GPT-4 (costly, proprietary) → **Qwen2.5-7B + hadith LoRA** (open, HuggingFace hosted)
- ChromaDB (local) → **FAISS** (same index as BasilSuhail, one unified semantic layer)
- No root context → **root family + grade injected into prompt**: *"The retrieved hadiths belong to the `statecraft` family, with roots ملك, حكم, خلف. Grade: 3 sahih, 2 hasan."*

**Status:** Planned for Phase 4. Not yet built.

## Rebuilding the Data

If you add new hadith books or want to regenerate from scratch:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
# + CAMeL Tools (requires separate data download):
pip install camel-tools
camel_data -i morphology-db-msa-r13

# 2. Fix root assignments (run once after any CAMeL rebuild)
python src/patch_word_defs.py

# 3. Rebuild concordance (inverted index)
python src/enrich_data.py --step concordance

# 4. Rebuild root bridge + family corpus
python src/build_bridge.py

# 5. Rebuild chord graphs
python src/build_chord.py

# 6. Run full audit to verify coverage
python src/audit.py
```

**To add a new book:** Drop the JSON files into `app/data/sunni/your_book_name/` following the existing format (index.json + chapter files), then rerun steps 3–4.

**To add a new thematic family:** Edit `src/add_families.py`, add your family block, run it, then rerun `build_bridge.py`.

## Known Gaps and Roadmap

### Data gaps (acknowledged)
- **الله root (أله):** `الله` appears in ~100% of all hadiths and is correctly treated as a stop word. The root أله has 1,879 Quran ayahs but cannot be meaningfully indexed against specific hadiths.
- **~315 zero-hadith roots:** Mostly hamza-initial roots (أتي, شيأ, رأي, أخذ) where CAMeL Tools' normalization doesn't match the concordance vocabulary. Patching the most important ones (أمر, ولي, يوم, أرض, وقي, أمن) was done; the rest are lower priority.
- **Family noise:** A single shared root is sufficient for a hadith to appear in a family. A hadith mentioning `خرج` (to leave) appears in `end_of_times` even if it's about ordinary travel. A relevance threshold (requiring 2+ family roots) would improve precision.
- **Isnad narrator grades:** `app/isnad.html` visualizes transmission chains (37,454 Musannaf chains, 11 books) but narrator coloring by grade is not yet active. KASHAF's grade data (`narrator_grades.json`, 17,093 narrators) uses Arabic names from Taqrib al-Tahdhib, while the isnad parser extracts names from raw Arabic text — the forms don't match directly. Fuzzy Arabic name matching is needed to link the two.
- **Isnad circular links:** D3-sankey rejects cycles in the data, so some books currently show a layout error. Pre-processing to break/remove cycles before rendering is a pending fix.
- **No per-hadith grade in source data:** The source book JSONs contain only `arabic`, `english`, `id`, `idInBook`. Hadith-level authentication grades (Sahih/Hasan/Da'if) are not in the source data and must be sourced separately.

### Planned phases
| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Data pipeline + concordance + bridge | ✅ Complete |
| 1 | Isnad visualizer (D3 Sankey, 11 books) | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Semantic search (FAISS + multilingual-e5-small, 87k hadiths) | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Conversational Q&A (RAG + Qwen2.5-0.5B) | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | App scaffold: reader, root panel, family view | 🔄 Next |
| 5 | Isnad narrator grade matching (Arabic fuzzy matching) | ⬜ Planned |
| 6 | Curated HadithReference tafsir table | ⬜ Planned |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome in these areas:

- **Adding hadith books** — especially graded collections with isnad data
- **Improving root coverage** — fixing CAMeL Tools gaps for specific roots
- **Curating HadithReference links** — scholarly tafsir connections between specific ayahs and hadiths
- **Adding thematic families** — new groupings of roots for under-served topics
- **Translation layer** — English/Urdu/French gloss improvements in word_defs
